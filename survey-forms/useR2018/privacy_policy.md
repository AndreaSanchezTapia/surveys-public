## Purpose of Data Collection

Forwards collects data to 

 - identify groups that are under-represented with respect to their 
 participation in R community activities;
 - monitor how representation of these groups changes over time;
 - identify reasons for under-representation, and to
 - gather ideas and volunteers for actions that can be taken to encourage wider participation.

## Means of Data Collection

Forwards collects data via

 - its own surveys;
 - collaboration with academic researchers;
 - collaboration with community organizers.
 
## Data Security

Forwards will limit the data collected to that necessary for the task at hand. 
Since most surveys/forms will contain direct identifiers (name, email) and/or 
personal information (age, ethnicity, sexuality) we treat all data collected 
as confidential and take action to protect against breaches of personal 
identifiable information.

### Data collection

For surveys conducted by Forwards or in partnership with collaborators, we 
ensure a secure survey/form platform is used. In particular, we ensure the 
platform is GDPR compliant. Access to the platform is restricted to a small 
number of Forwards members and/or collaborators for the purpose of collecting 
and downloading the data. Once the data is downloaded the copy on the 
survey/form platform is deleted.

### Data storage

#### Surveys

Raw data containing personal and potentially identifiable information is stored 
in a private GitHub repository. Access to this repository is restricted to the 
[survey team](https://github.com/orgs/forwards/teams/surveys/members). This data 
may be shared with selected collaborators to assist us with statistical analysis 
and potentially other academic researchers whose aims are consistent with our 
own, for example those studying participation in open source projects. All 
collaborators are expected to observe good security practices, for example 
working on password-protected computers in private or work spaces only.

#### Other forms

Other forms may be used to collect data for a specific purpose, e.g. 
applications for a diversity scholarship scheme or expressions of interest in a 
conference buddy scheme. The data for these forms will either be stored in a 
private GitHub repository or offline, with access restricted to the Forwards 
members responsible for the task. 

### Data retention

Raw data is kept according to the following schedules:

| Survey/form type                    | Retention time                   |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Diversity scholarship applications  | Until all scholarships paid out  |
| Expression of interest form         | Until task/event completed       |
| Demographic/community survey        | Indefinitely                     |

Data that has served its purpose will be deleted or anonymised - anonymised 
data may be kept to inform future activities.

### Data publication

#### Surveys

Since survey data is of interest to the community at large, we do publish the 
results, but only in forms that minimise risk of personal identification. This means presenting aggregate summaries (as for example in this blog post [Mapping useRs](http://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/01/13/mapping-users/) blog 
post) or modifying the data to achieve at least 3-anonymity (as for the 
`useR2016` data published in the [**forwards**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forwards) package.

#### Other forms

Data collected in other forms will not be published or shared with third 
parties.
