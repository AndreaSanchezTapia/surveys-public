As part of introductory comments:

This survey asks for personal and potentially identifiable information. Please 
note that all demographic questions are optional and you may prefer to leave 
some questions unanswered to preserve your anonymity.

We're asking these questions because the R community is actively working
to improve the inclusiveness and openness of our online and offline spaces.
Taking snapshots of demographic data
allows us to see how we're doing over time, and adjust accordingly if the
results suggest our events are excluding certain demographics.

To protect respondents, we guarantee that answers will be treated with full 
confidentiality. Although high-level summaries will 
be shared, the raw data will be kept strictly private. For an example of how 
the demographic data was reported from previous useR! surveys, see the 
[Mapping useRs](https://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/01/13/mapping-users/) blog 
post. For full details of how your data will be handled, see our 
[Privacy policy](https://forwards.github.io/docs/privacy_policy/).
