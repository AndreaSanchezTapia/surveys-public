As part of introductory comments:

This survey asks for personal and potentially identifiable information. Please 
note that all demographic questions are optional and you may prefer to leave 
some questions unanswered to preserve your anonymity. Consider which 
demographics you wish to represent!

To protect respondents, we guarantee that answers will be treated with full 
confidentiality. Although high-level aggregates of individual questions will 
be shared, the raw data will be kept strictly private. For an example of how 
the demographic data was reported from previous useR! surveys, see the 
[Mapping useRs](http://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/01/13/mapping-users/) blog 
post.

Special note on LGBT+ question:

We're asking these questions because the R community is actively working
to improve the inclusiveness and openness of our online and offline spaces
and environments. Taking snapshots of data around sexuality and gender
allows us to see how we're doing over time, and adjust accordingly when the
results suggest our events are excluding demographics. All answers will be
covered by the same confidentiality process as the survey as a whole, and
answering is strictly optional.
