# Forwards useR! 2019 Survey

[Forwards](https://forwards.github.io), the R Foundation taskforce for under-represented groups, invites you to participate in the useR! 2019 survey.

Taking snapshots of demographic data allows us to see how we're doing over time, and adjust accordingly if the results suggest our events are excluding certain demographics. The legal basis for processing this data is your consent.

Please note that all questions are optional and no explicit identifiers (name, email, IP address) are recorded.
