# Forwards useR! 2020 Survey

[Forwards](https://forwards.github.io), the R Foundation taskforce for under-represented groups, invites you to participate in the useR! 2020 survey.

Please only fill in the survey when you have watched/attended all the useR! contributions that you plan to watch/attend in July (the survey is open to people that would have liked to participate but did not).

This survey includes questions regarding personal and potentially identifiable information. We ask these questions because the R community is actively working to improve the inclusiveness and openness of our online and offline spaces. Taking snapshots of demographic data allows us to see how we're doing over time, and adjust accordingly if the results suggest our events are excluding certain demographics. The legal basis for processing this data is your consent.

Please note that all questions are optional and no explicit identifiers (name, email, IP address) are recorded.

There are 20 questions in this survey, which should take about 5 minutes to complete.
