# Survey Team Meeting 2020-06-11

## Issues

1. De-duplication:  add exit question to survey so people come back later
2. Spam: exclude responses that don't answer (say) at least one R-related question


## How to share the survey

- add slide at the end of presentation (once a session in livestream part)
- add link in the YouTube description
- also, email tutorial participants
- make it clear that people should only answer the survey once they have finished participating in the virtual conference. E.g. 
"Thanks for attending! If this is the last useR! session you plan to attend in July, please answer the Forwards survey: <link>"

## New questions in survey

- add breakout session to special type

- As early as possible, check eligibility:
    - how many useR! 2020 events have you attended? (bins) - include 0, if zero  -> was there something that preventing you from attending? Is there something we can do better next time?   
    - do you plan on attending more? if yes -> exit

- have you been to any of these useR! 2020 events :
    - livestream
    - contributed video
    - tutorial

## Feedback form (simple, all optional, no personal info)
- Dropdown of talks/tutorials
- simple feedback on tutorial
- basic background on R
- open comment

## Misc

- check whether people can edit their responses
