# useR! 2021 Satisfactory Survey

Welcome to the useR! 2021 survey, run by Forwards (the R Foundation taskforce for women and underrepresented groups) and the useR! 2021 Diversity, Accessibility, and Inclusion Team.

This survey is open to anyone that is registered in the conference.

This survey includes questions regarding personal and potentially identifiable information. We ask these questions because the R community is actively working to improve the inclusiveness and openness of our online and offline spaces. Taking snapshots of demographic data allows us to see how we're doing over time, and adjust accordingly if the results suggest our events are excluding certain demographics. The legal basis for processing this data is your consent.

Please note that all questions are optional and no explicit identifiers (name, email, IP address) are recorded.

Based on previous years, the survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.

This survey is anonymous.
