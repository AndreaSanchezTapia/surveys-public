useR! 2021 Survey
Welcome to the useR! 2021 survey, run by Forwards, the R Foundation taskforce for women and underrepresented groups.

This survey is open to anyone that is registered in the conference and plans to attend or is attending any of the useR! 2021 keynotes, regular talks, elevator pitches, panels and incubators, tutorials, and social events. <!--It is also open to those that wished to participate in useR! 2021 but could not. <!--this is a posteriori-->

This survey includes questions regarding personal and potentially identifiable information. We ask these questions because the R community is actively working to improve the inclusiveness and openness of our online and offline spaces. Taking snapshots of demographic data allows us to see how we're doing over time, and adjust accordingly if the results suggest our events are excluding certain demographics. The legal basis for processing this data is your consent.

Please note that all questions are optional and no explicit identifiers (name, email, IP address) are recorded.

Based on previous years, the survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.

There are 24 questions in this survey.
